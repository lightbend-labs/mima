# Releasing

See the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) if this is your first release.

## Step 0: Create a new release tracking

1. Click ["new issue"][issues/new];
2. Opening the raw [RELEASING.md][] content; and
3. Copying the following release checklist, up to "You are done!", into the new issue and create it.

## Release checklist

* [ ] [Check Travis CI][travis-ci] passes against the latest Scala versions.
* [ ] [Create a new milestone][milestones/new] for the release you are about to perform, if one [doesn't exist][milestones/list].
* [ ] [Create a new milestone][milestones/new] for the release after this one.
* [ ] [Draft a new release][releases/new] for the release, by [comparing changes][compare/view].
* [ ] Bump the version in the `README.md` and `git commit -am 'Release 0.x.y`.
* [ ] Run `git tag -a -s 0.x.y -m 'Version 0.x.y`. The name of the tag should NOT have a 'v' prefix.
* [ ] In sbt run `reload` and `show version` in sbt to verify the version.
* [ ] In sbt run `clean`, particularly if you've recently bumped `scalaVersion`.
* [ ] In sbt run `publishSigned`. You should start seeing "published mima-.. to https://oss.sonatype.org/service/local/staging/deploy/maven2/..".
* [ ] [Find and close][sonatype/staging-repos] your staging repository.  (See Sonatype's [Releasing the Deployment][sonatype/guide] guide.)
* [ ] Release the sbt plugin artifact in [Bintray's Web UI][sbt-mima/view] (or run `sbtplugin/bintrayRelease` in sbt.)
* [ ] Update the MiMa version in `plugins.sbt` and for `mimaPreviousArtifacts`, and clear out `mimaBinaryIssueFilters`.
* [ ] Test the staged artifacts by uncommenting `stagingResolvers` in `plugins.sbt` and `build.sbt` and `reload`ing in sbt and running `mimaReportBinaryIssues`.
* [ ] Recomment `stagingResolvers`, `git commit -am 'Update sbt-mima-plugin to 0.x.y`, and PR it (`hub pull-request`).
* [ ] [Find and release][sonatype/staging-repos] your staging repository.
* [ ] [Close][milestones/list] the milestone.
* [ ] [Find and merge][prs/list] your update PR. You may poll [repo1 directly][repo1/list] (note the trailing slash in the URL).
* [ ] Run `git push --follow-tags` to push the tag.
* [ ] [Find and hit "Publish Release"][releases/list] on the draft GitHub release.

## Prerequisites

* repo push rights
* publishing crendentials for Sonatype and Bintray, typically in `~/.sbt/1.0/credentials.sbt`:

```scala
    credentials += Credentials("Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager", "oss.sonatype.org", <username>, <password>)
    credentials += Credentials("Bintray API Realm", "api.bintray.com", <username>, <password>)
```

(Make sure you're not using an ancient version of sbt-pgp in `~/.sbt/1.0/plugins`.)
